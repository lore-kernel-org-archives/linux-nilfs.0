Interesting. I didn't know about that work. I guess the tradeoff is pretty
obvious - my patches are more conservative (changing less) and as a result
the API is not as neat as Kent's one. That being said I was also thinking
about something similar to what Kent did but what I didn't like about such
iterator is that you still need to specially handle the cases where you
break out of the loop (you need to do that with pagevecs too but there it
is kind of obvious from the API).
