Depends on what you are trying to do (flush has multiple meanings, so
using can be ambiguous).  BLKFLSBUF will write out any dirty buffers,
*and* empty the buffer cache.  I use it when benchmarking e2fsck
optimization.  It doesn't do anything for the page cache.  If you are
measuring the time to write a file, using fsync() or sync() will
include the time to actually write the data to disk.  It won't empty
caches, though; if you are going to measure read as well as writes,
then you'll probably want to do something like "echo 3 >
/proc/sys/vm/drop-caches".
