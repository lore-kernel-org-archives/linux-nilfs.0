Well, I do "sync" after each operation, so the data should be on disk, but 
that doesn't mean it'll clear the filesystem buffers - but this doesn't 
happen that often in the real world too. Also, all filesystem were tested 
equally (I hope), yet some filesystem perform better than another - even 
if all the content copied/tar'ed/removed would perfectly well fit into the 
machines RAM.

Thanks, I'll have a look at it and perhaps even integrate it in the 
wrapper script.

Indeed, I was surpised to see JFS perform that good and XFS of course is 
one of the best too - I just wanted to point out that both of them 
are strangely slow at times (removing or creating many files) - not what I 
expected.

True, the TODO list in the script ("different benchmark options") is in 
there for a reason :-)
