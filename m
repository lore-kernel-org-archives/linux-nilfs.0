Not me, I'm comparing filesystems - and when the HBA or whatever plays 
tricks and "sync" doesn't flush all the data, it'll do so for every tested 
filesystem. Of course, filesystem could handle "sync" differently, and 
they probably do, hence the different times they take to complete. That's 
what my tests are about: timing comparision (does that still fall under 
the "benchmark" category?), not functional comparision. That's left as a 
task for the reader of these results: "hm, filesystem xy is so much faster 
when doing foo, why is that? And am I willing to sacrifice e.g. proper 
syncs to gain more speed?"

Again, I don't argue with "hardware caches will have effects", but that's 
not the point of these tests. Of course hardware is different, but 
filesystems are too and I'm testing filesystems (on the same hardware).
