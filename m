Hello all,

I have been using nilfs for some time now, and am quite happy with the
features and performance.

I have also been promoting it as a filesystem of choice for 'appliances'
that as normal course do not get gracefully shutdown (power switch off).
This robustness bears out in my own testing.

The recent posts regarding "corrupt root inode" have me a little concerned
about my understanding.

Is my current assumption correct, in that if the hardware does something
weird and scribbles badly to the filesystem, then obviously all bets are
off --- otherwise nilfs should be robust against the 'power off' (no
graceful shutdown)?

Thanks in advance,
Mark T.
