I think this is really dangerous and we shouldn't do this. You are quite
likely to lose IO errors in such calls because you will ignore all errors
that happened during previous background writeback or even for IO that
managed to complete before we called filemap_fdatawait(). Maybe we need to
keep the original set-clear-bit IO error reporting for these cases, until
we can convert them to fdatawait_range_since()?

So this conversion looks wrong and actually points to a larger issue with
the scheme. The problem is there are two mappings that come into play here
- file_inode(file)->i_mapping which is the data mapping and
NODE_MAPPING(sbi) which is the metadata mapping (and this is not a problem
specific to f2fs. For example ext2 also uses this scheme where block
devices' mapping is the metadata mapping). And we need to merge error
information from these two mappings so for the stamping scheme to work,
we'd need two stamps stored in struct file. One for data mapping and one
for metadata mapping. Or maybe there's some more clever scheme but for now
I don't see one...
