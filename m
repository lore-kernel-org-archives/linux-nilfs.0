Did you include the "sync" in part of what you timed?  Peter was quite
right --- the fact that the measured bandwidth in your "cp" test is
five times faster than the disk bandwidth as measured by hdparm, and
many file systems had exactly the same bandwidth, makes me very
suspicious that what was being measured was primarily memory bandwidth
--- and not very useful when trying to measure file system
performance.
