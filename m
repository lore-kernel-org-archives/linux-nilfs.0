Thanks Larry, that was exactly my point[0] too, I should add that to the 
results page to avoid further confusion or misassumptions:

I realize however that on the same results page the bonnie++ tests were 
run with a filesize *specifically* set to not utilize the filesystem 
buffers any more but the measure *disk* performance while my "generic* 
tests do something else - and thus cannot be compared to the bonnie++ or 
hdparm results.

I was using "sync" to make sure that the data "should" be on the disks 
now, I did not want to flush the filesystem buffers during the "generic" 
tests.

Thanks,
Christian.
