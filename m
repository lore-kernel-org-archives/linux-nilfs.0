In my "generic" tests[0] I do "sync" after each of the cp/tar/rm 
operations.

That's right, and that's what I replied to Peter on jfs-discussion[1]:

  True, because I'm tarring up ~2.7GB of content while the box is equipped
  with 8GB of RAM. So it *should* be the same for all filesystems, as 
  Linux could easily hold all this in its caches. Still, jfs and zfs 
  manage to be slower than the rest.

For the bonnie++ tests I chose an explicit filesize of 16GB, two times the 
size of the machine's RAM to make sure it will tests the *disks* 
performance. And to be consistent across one benchmark run, I should have 
copied/tarred/removed 16GB as well. However, I figured not to do that - 
but to *use* the filesystem buffers instead of ignoring them. After all, 
it's not about disk performace (that's what hdparm could be for) but 
filesystem performance (or comparision, more exactly) - and I'm not exited 
about the fact, that almost all filesystems are copying with ~276MB/s but 
I'm wondering why zfs is 13 times slower when copying data or xfs takes 
200 seconds longer than other filesystems, while it's handling the same 
size as all the others. So no, please don't compare the bonnie++ results 
against my "generic" results withing these results - as they're 
(obviously, I thought) taken with different parameters/content sizes.

Christian.
