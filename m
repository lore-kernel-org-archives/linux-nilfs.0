Hmmmm.... I suppose here should be a link to such set? :)
No link? Than I suppose benchmark results are pretty much in sync with
what they are supposed to show.

It depends on the size of untarred object, for linux kernel tarball and
common several gigs of RAM it is very valid not to run a sync after the
tar, since writeback will take care about it.

Was not able to resist to write a small notice, what no matter what, but
whatever benchmark is running, it _does_ show system behaviour in one
or another condition. And when system behaves rather badly, it is quite
a common comment, that benchmark was useless. But it did show that
system has a problem, even if rarely triggered one :)

Not an ext4 nitpick of course.
