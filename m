Good, but not good enough for many tests... info sync

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.2

NOTES
       On Linux, sync is only guaranteed to  schedule  the  dirty  blocks  for
       writing;  it  can  actually take a short time before all the blocks are
       finally written.

This is consistent with all the feels-like-unix OSes I have used.

And to make it even more random, the hardware (drive/controller)
write cache state needs to be accounted for, and what the filesystem
does if anything to try to ensure device-cache-to-media consistency.

That does not mean I'm saying the tests are invalid or not useful,
only that people need to evaluate "what do they really tell me".
