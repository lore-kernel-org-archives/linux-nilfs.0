This no longer applies with the new writeback error tracking and
reporting infrastructure.

-		 * There's one open issue:

-		 * The EIO will be only reported on the next IO

-		 * Normally Linux has two mechanisms to pass IO error
-		 * first through the AS_EIO flag in the address space
-		 * and then through the PageError flag in the page.
-		 * Since we drop pages on memory failure handling the
-		 * only mechanism open to use is through AS_AIO.
-		 *
-		 * This has the disadvantage that it gets cleared on
-		 * the first operation that returns an error, while
-		 * the PageError bit is more sticky and only cleared
-		 * when the page is reread or dropped.  If an
-		 * application assumes it will always get error on
-		 * fsync, but does other operations on the fd before
-		 * and the page is dropped between then the error
-		 * will not be properly reported.
-		 *
-		 * This can already happen even without hwpoisoned
-		 * pages: first on metadata IO errors (which only
-		 * report through AS_EIO) or when the page is dropped
-		 * at the wrong time.
-		 *
-		 * So right now we assume that the application DTRT on
-		 * the first EIO, but we're not worse than other parts
-		 * of the kernel.
+		 * Note that errors are reported only once per file
+		 * description, but should be reported on all open file
+		 * descriptions for this inode.
