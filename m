Thanks. I'm cleaning up the comments like you suggest.

I don't think so. If we want to do that, then we'll need to redrive the
cmpxchg to set the SEEN flag if it's now clear. Storing the value in
"since" is effectively sampling it, so you do have to mark it seen.

The good news is that I think that "new" is just as valid a value to
store here as *eseq would be. It ends up representing an errseq_t value
that never actually got stored in eseq, but that's OK with the way this
works.
