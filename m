David,
any progress on this patch series?

I never saw an updated version of this patch series after the last round =
of
reviews, but it would be great to move it forward.  I have filefrag =
patches
in my e2fsprogs tree waiting for an updated version of your patch.

I recall the main changes were:
- add FIEMAP_EXTENT_PHYS_LENGTH flag to indicate if fe_phys_length was =
valid
- rename fe_length to fe_logi_length and #define fe_length =
fe_logi_length
- always fill in fe_phys_length (=3D fe_logi_length for uncompressed =
files)
  and set FIEMAP_EXTENT_PHYS_LENGTH whether the extent is compressed or =
not
- add WARN_ONCE() in fiemap_fill_next_extent() as described below

I don't know if there was any clear statement about whether there should =
be
separate FIEMAP_EXTENT_PHYS_LENGTH and FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_COMPRESSED =
flags,
or if the latter should be implicit?  Probably makes sense to have =
separate
flags.  It should be fine to use:

#define FIEMAP_EXTENT_PHYS_LENGTH	0x00000010

since this flag was never used.

Cheers, Andreas
