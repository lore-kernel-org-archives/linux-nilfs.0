I'd actually thought the same thing while reading the patch, but I =
figured
people would object because it implies that old kernels will return a
physical length of 0 bytes (which might be valid) and badly-written =
tools
will not work correctly on older kernels.  That said, applications =
_should_
be checking the FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_COMPRESSED flag, and I suspect in the
future fewer developers will be confused if fe_phys_length =3D=3D =
fe_length
going forward.

If the initial tools get it right (in particular filefrag), then =
hopefully
others will get it correct also.

Seems reasonable to have a WARN_ONCE() in that case.  That would catch =
bugs
in the filesystem, code as well:

	WARN_ONCE(phys_len !=3D lgcl_len &&
		  !(flags & FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_COMPRESSED),
		  "physical len %llu !=3D logical length %llu without =
DATA_COMPRESSED\n",
		  phys_len, logical_len, phys_len, logical_len);

Would it make sense to rename fe_length to fe_logi_length (or something,
I'm open to suggestions), and have a compat macro:

#define fe_length fe_logi_length

around for older applications?  That way, new developers would start to
use the new name, old applications would still compile for both newer =
and
older interfaces, and it doesn't affect the ABI at all.

Actually, I was thinking just the opposite for this field.  It seems =
useful
that the requirement for DATA_COMPRESSED being set is beside =
fe_phys_length
so that anyone using this field sees the correlation clearly.  I don't =
expect
everyone would read and understand the meaning of all the flags when =
looking
at the data structure.
